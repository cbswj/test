# A sparsity-inducing matrix A is attached to a normal convolution. The matrix acts as the hinge between filter
pruning and decomposition. By enforcing group sparsity to the columns and rows of the matrix, equivalent pruning and
decomposition operations can be obtained. For pruning, the product of W and the column-reduced matrix Ac, i.e. Wc acts
as the new convolutional filter. To save computation during decomposition the reduced matrices Wr and Ar are used as two
convolutional filters.
